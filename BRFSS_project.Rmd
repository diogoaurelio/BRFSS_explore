## Introduction

### Summary
This analysis was developed in the context of a mini project for the Course 
It uses a dataset about Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

### Abstract/General information about the dataset 

"The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a collaborative project between all of the states in the United States (US) and participating US territories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The BRFSS is administered and supported by CDC's Population Health Surveillance Branch, under the Division of Population Health at the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. BRFSS is an ongoing surveillance system designed to measure behavioral risk factors for the non-institutionalized adult population (18 years of age and older) residing in the US. The BRFSS was initiated in 1984, with 15 states collecting surveillance data on risk behaviors through monthly telephone interviews. Over time, the number of states participating in the survey increased; by 2001, 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands were participating in the BRFSS. Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam collect data annually and American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau collect survey data over a limited point- in-time (usually one to three months). In this document, the term “state” is used to refer to all areas participating in BRFSS, including the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The BRFSS objective is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population. Factors assessed by the BRFSS in 2013 include tobacco use, HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention, exercise, immunization, health status, healthy days — health-related quality of life, health care access, inadequate sleep, hypertension awareness, cholesterol awareness, chronic health conditions, alcohol consumption, fruits and vegetables consumption, arthritis burden, and seatbelt use. Since 2011, BRFSS conducts both landline telephone- and cellular telephone-based surveys. In conducting the BRFSS landline telephone survey, interviewers collect data from a randomly selected adult in a household. In conducting the cellular telephone version of the BRFSS questionnaire, interviewers collect data from an adult who participates by using a cellular telephone and resides in a private residence or college housing.

Health characteristics estimated from the BRFSS pertain to the non-institutionalized adult population, aged 18 years or older, who reside in the US. In 2013, additional question sets were included as optional modules to provide a measure for several childhood health and wellness indicators, including asthma prevalence for people aged 17 years or younger."

## Setup

### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

### Load data

In my repository, the data file is located in a dedicated directory called 'data'. 
Thus, it requires some "extra" effort to load it, which is NOT necessary in case you decide to co-locate the dataset to this R mark-down file.  

To load the dataset to the current working environment, you can do as follows: 

```{r load-data}
script.dir = getwd() 
data.dir = paste(sep="/", script.dir, "data")
data.file = paste(sep="/", data.dir, "brfss2013.RData")
load(data.file)
```
This will store in your global environment dataframe called "brfss2013".

## Part 1: Data


The first thing one can realize is that the dataset contains an extensive amount of variables (330), and observations (491775): 

```{r dimensions-dataset}
dim(brfss2013)
```

Lets get more meta info about the dataset:

```{r summary-overview}
str(brfss2013)
#sapply(brfss2013, class)
summary(brfss2013)
```

## Part 3: Exploratory data analysis

NOTE: Insert code chunks as needed by clicking on the "Insert a new code chunk" 
button (green button with orange arrow) above. Make sure that your code is visible
in the project you submit. Delete this note when before you submit your work.

**Research quesion 1:**

```{r}

```



**Research quesion 2:**

```{r}

```



**Research quesion 3:**



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
